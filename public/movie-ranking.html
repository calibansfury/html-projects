<h1>Calibansfury's Best Movies</h1>

<h2>My favorite movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Unforgiven</h3>
<p>An exceptional film about retired gunslinger William Munny.  Munny, known for his steel nerves and cruelty when drinking, reformed himself when he met a woman and fell in love.  After his wife's premature passing, Munny is left as a fish out of water, attempting to raise his children as a common pig farmer, and having little success.  One day, a young man comes to him, claiming to be a dangerous gunslinger himself, and asks Munny to be his partner.  Munny reluctantly agrees out of desperation, as the money would be of great use to him.  Munny struggles with the life of violence he gave up, the regrets he harbors for killing so many, and struggles to reconcile who he was and who he wants to be.</p>

<h3>Braveheart</h3>
<p>An epic retelling of the story of William Wallace, a Scottsman who rebelled against the unrivaled power of the King of England.</p>

<h3>Schindler's List</h3>
<p>The story of Oscar Schindler, a nazi war profiteer who decided to aid and rescue Jewish prisoners whom he employed.</p>
